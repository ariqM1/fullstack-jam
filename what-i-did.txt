DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY: COMPANY LIST MANAGEMENT

✅ BACKEND (FastAPI / Python)

🔌 New API Endpoints

1. Add Selected Companies
   POST /collections/{source_collection_id}/add-to/{target_collection_id}
   Payload:
   {
     "company_ids": [1, 2, 3]
   }
   Response:
   {
     "operation_id": "abc123"
   }

2. Add All Companies
   POST /collections/{source_collection_id}/add-all-to/{target_collection_id}
   No payload
   Response:
   {
     "operation_id": "def456"
   }

3. Check Operation Status
   GET /collections/operations/{operation_id}
   Response:
   {
     "status": "in_progress",
     "processed": 1350,
     "total": 50000,
     "error": null
   }

⚙️ Background Processing

- Uses BackgroundTasks to prevent blocking for large inserts (~100ms throttle per insert).
- Duplicate entries are skipped.
- Operation state: pending, in_progress, completed, failed.
- Tracks progress (insert count vs. total).
- Stored and updated in DB for status polling.

🧱 Backend File Changes

- backend/backend/routes/collections.py  
  → Added endpoints + background task logic

✅ FRONTEND (React / TypeScript)

🧩 Component Enhancements: CompanyTable.tsx

- Added:
  - Checkbox-based company selection
  - "Add Selected" and "Add All" buttons
  - Target collection dropdown selector
  - Linear progress bar for operation tracking
  - Error display and notifications
- Table auto-refreshes on operation completion.
- Buttons are disabled during ongoing operations.

🔌 API Integration: jam-api.ts

- addCompaniesToCollection(sourceId, targetId, companyIds)
- addAllCompaniesToCollection(sourceId, targetId)
- getOperationStatus(operationId)

Includes relevant TypeScript interfaces.

📂 Other Changes

- App.tsx – ensures company/collection data is passed into CompanyTable.

🔍 DEV NOTES

- Frontend polls /operations/{operation_id} every 1s during operations.
- All insertions honor DB throttling (100ms delay each).
- Duplicate company IDs are filtered before DB call.
- Estimated time for 50k companies: ~1.4 hours.
- All new endpoints tested with Dockerized backend.

🚧 Future Dev Considerations
- Switch polling to WebSocket for real-time updates
- Batch inserts to speed up backend processing
- Add undo or bulk-delete operations
- Persist operation history/logs in backend
